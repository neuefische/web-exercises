/* --- || Goal: Write a fat arrow function/ arrow function expression that adds some additional features to our basic vending machine. - */

/* --- ! Read all of the tasks carefully before starting to code ! --- */

/* 1. Remember the "vendingMachine" function you've created as part of the Functions 1 challenges?
Now write the same function still called "vendingMachine", but as an arrow function expression. */

/* 2. The function should include one parameter: "money". */

/* 3. 
In the function body, implement the following logic:
- an early return for the condition "money === 0"
- an if condition each (!) for "money === 1", "money === 2" and  "money === 3" that
  log different strings to the console, such as "Here's your water!", "Here's your juice!", etc.
- another if condition for when "money" either equals "4" or anything above that logs "Too much money!"
  to the console.

  The behavior we're looking for is to get different (or no) drinks each when we 
  pass the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4+ to the "vendingMachine" function as an argument.

/* 4. Call your function with a number! * /

/* If you're struggling, a good first step may be looking at the function you've written before again. ... */
