# Simple To-do-List

Everyone has something to do. Let's make sure that no one forgets anything.

## Task

### 1. Listen to the submit event

- Write an event listener for the form submit.
- Log the user data to the console (we will use the data on the second part of this exercise).
- Reset the form after submit.
- After submit, focus the input field with the name `headline`.

### 2. Create list entries

There already is a `ul` for our submitted Todos, so let's create list items and append them to this list.

Switch to the index.js file and make things happen!

Question: required input fields?
