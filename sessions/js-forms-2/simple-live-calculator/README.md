# Simple Live Calculator

Let's build a simple live calculator!

## Task

There are two form fields where the user can enter a value.
As soon as one of these values change, both values shall be multiplied. The result is to be rendered with the help of the output element.

## Hints

The following hints might guide you:

- You may need to declare global `let` variables for both input fields and initialize them with a starting number.
- Consider the `input` event for both input fields; on each input, you want to set the event target's value to your global variables.
- If you calculate the result with a `calculateResult()` function, you can set the `textContent` of your output to this result.
- Don't forget to call `calculateResult()` on every input event!

Switch to the index.html file and validate the form in the mentioned way!
