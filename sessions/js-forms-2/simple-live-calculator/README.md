# Simple Live Calculator

Let's build a simple live calculator!

## Task

There are two form fields where the user can enter a value.
As soon as one of these values change, both values shall be multiplied. The result is to be rendered with the help of the output element.

## Hints

The following hints might guide you:

- Consider the `input` event for both input fields.
- How do you set the text content for an HTML element again?

Switch to the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) file and implement the task.
