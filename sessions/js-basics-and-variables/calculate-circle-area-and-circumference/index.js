How can you calculate the area and circumference of a pizza - oops, I mean a circle? Let`s find out!

1. Initialize a variable to represent the radius of the circle. For example, you can set `radius` to a specific value, like 5.

2. Calculate the area of the circle using the formula `Math.PI * radius ** 2`, and store the result in a variable called `circleArea`.

3. Calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula `2 * Math.PI * radius`, and store the result in a variable called `circumference`.

4. Display the results by logging them to the console. Use `console.log` to print the area and circumference.

5. Run your JavaScript program to see the calculated area and circumference of the circle with the specified radius.
