Let's build a little program for tracking your savings goals!

1. Set up three variables:
   1. startingBalance: Initialize this variable with your initial savings balance. For example, you can set it to 1000.
   2. monthlyContribution: Set this variable to the amount you plan to save each month.
   3. months: Specify the number of months for which you want to track your savings. For instance, you can set it to 12 for a year.
2. Calculate the total savings after the specified number of months by using the formula startingBalance + (monthlyContribution \* months) and store the result in a variable called totalSavings.
3. Print the result by using console.log to display the total savings you'll have after the specified number of months.
4. Run your JavaScript program to see how much money you'll have saved after the specified time period.
