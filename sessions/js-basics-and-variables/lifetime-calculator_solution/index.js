/*
Lets calculate some interesting facts based on the age of a user! It is expected that the user of this program provides a number as the input. The code for receiving this input is provided below.

Calculate the following:
- The number of days the person has lived.
- The expected number of remaining days for the person. Use an expected life span of 80 years.
- The percentage of already lived time in relation to this life expectancy.
- The commulative number of days the person already slept in their life. Assume that the person sleeps on average 8 hours per day.

Make sure to log every number with a nice descriptive text.

ðŸ’¡ You can ignore leap years.
