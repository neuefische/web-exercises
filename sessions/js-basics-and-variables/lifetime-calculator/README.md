# JS Basics and Variables: Lifetime Calculator

## Tasks

In this challenge, you’ll create a program to calculate interesting statistics based on the age of a user.

Please switch to the `index.js` file to begin the exercise, where you’ll find all instructions.

Hint: To test your work, run the code in the terminal by replacing `<age>` with the user’s age:

```bash
node index.js <age>
// e.g.
node index.js 32
```

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `index.js` file.

> ❗️ This project is JavaScript with Node only. Run the code in the terminal as shown above.
