# Objects and Arrays

In the exercises it is necessary to adjust the described variable between the lines " --v-- write code here --v--" and " --^-- write code here --^--". The variable is to be assigned a value from an array with several objects. The value can correspond to a simple data type as well as to an array or object. At the end there should be "well done" outputed in the console. Otherwise, an error message is output. The exact task can be found in the respective exercises.
