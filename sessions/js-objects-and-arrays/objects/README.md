# JS Objects and Arrays: Objects

## Tasks

In this exercise, you will encounter the following tasks:

- Assign or add a variable to a value within an object.
- Adjust the properties of an object variable.

Please switch to the `index.js` file to begin the exercises, where you’ll find the specific instructions.

To check if you’ve solved the tasks correctly, run `npm run test` and review the test results in the console.

## Notes

- You only need to touch the `index.js` file.
- This project is JavaScript-only. Please check the browser console (<kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>I</kbd>) for the output or run the tests to see the results.
- This challenge includes **tests** for the first time, with instructions on running them below in the “Development” section.

## Development

To work locally, please follow these steps:

### 1. Install dependencies:

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install` or `npm i`

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs the required packages listed under `dependencies`.

### 2. Start the development server:

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:

`npm run start`

This command will start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

> Alternatively you can use the Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code to view this project.  
> Select the HTML file you want to view, press <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>P</kbd>, search for `Live Preview: Show Preview` and confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

### 3. Run the tests:

To verify your solutions, run the tests with the following command:

`npm run test`

This command will execute the test scripts defined in the project, allowing you to see if your code passes all the tests. The results will be displayed in the terminal, showing which tests passed or failed.
