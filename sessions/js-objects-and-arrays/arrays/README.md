# Arrays

In the exercises it is necessary to adjust the described variable between the lines " --v-- write code here --v--" and " --^-- write code here --^--". The variable is either to be assigned to a value from an array, or the variable itself is an array and is to be adapted according to the specifications. At the end there should be "well done" outputed in the console. Otherwise, an error message is output. The exact task can be found in the respective exercises.
