# Recap Project 3: Rick and Morty App

In this recap project, you are going to create a single page app for browsing all the characters of the famous tv show "Rick and Morty".

You are going to work in a group. Create **only one project per group** using the [guide in the template section](./README.md#template) below!

🚀 Project Deployment to GitHub Pages is required: Please adhere to the deployment guidelines outlined in your repository's documentation `(https://github.com/spiced-academy/[your-cohort-name]-web-dev/blob/main/docs/github-pages.md)` for detailed instructions. In the URL replace `[your-cohort-name]` with your cohort's designated name.

---

## API

We are going to fetch all necessary information about the characters from a REST API specifically
designed for Rick and Morty. Check out the [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). You find all the
information you need in the docs.

> ❗️ This API has pagination, that means that you can fetch only 20 characters at a time.

---

## Create the Project

- Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where all your projects are located.
- Execute the following command to create a new project based on a template:

```bash
npx ghcd@latest spiced-academy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/recap-project-3/rick-and-morty-app
```

- Create a new empty repository on GitHub named `yourName-partnerName-ricky-and-morty`, link it to the created repository on your computer and push the code.
- Each member of the group clones the repository to their local machine.
- Follow the instructions given in the `README.md` file.

> 💡 Don't forget to work on feature branches, otherwise you might run into merge conflicts!

## Tasks

### Character Card Component

For now you have only one hard coded character card for Rick Sanchez in your HTML. We want to create
them dynamically in our JavaScript.

- Write a function `createCharacterCard` inside the `card.js` file and export it.
- You can use `innerHTML` to generate the HTML of the card. Cut the relevant HTML code of the card
  from the `index.html` and use it in your function.
- The following elements of the card need to be dynamic and change for each character:
  - the `src` of the image
  - the name of the character
  - the status, type and occurrences values
- HINT: go to the docs and look where you can find all the information in the character objects you
  will receive from the API.
- Think about which input parameters this function will need.
- The function finally returns the created `li` HTML element.

### Fetch the Data

Now we can fetch the character data from the API and generate our cards with it.

- Inside of the `index.js` create a function called `fetchCharacters`.
- Use your knowledge about fetching to get the first 20 characters from the API. You can find the
  correct API endpoint in the docs.
- Import the `createCharacterCard` function.
- After successfully fetching the character data, use array methods to create an HTML card for each
  character and append it to the `cardContainer`.
- Make sure that the `cardContainer` is emptied every time new characters are fetched (HINT: you can
  use `innerHTML = ''` for that).
- Call the function inside the `index.js`. Now you should see 20 cards in your app.

### Pagination

Great Job! But we want to see not only 20 characters, we want all of them! So lets implement the
pagination.

- By adding the string `?page=<pageIndex>` to the end of the fetch URL, you can receive the
  respective page of characters.
- Use here the state variable `page` to keep track of the current page index.
- Inside of the `info` part of the received data you can find the max page count.
- Add an event listener on each of the next and prev buttons which do the following
  - it is prevented that the page index could go higher than the max page index or below 1
  - the page index is increased / decreased
  - the `fetchCharacters` function is called
- Update the pagination display each time characters are fetched to show the current page index and
  the current max page index.

### The Search Bar

Now we want even more functionality in our app. We want to find individual characters by typing
their name into the search bar.

- Create a 'submit' event listener on the search bar.
- Update the state variable `searchQuery` with the current text inside the search bar every time
  this event is triggered.
- Modify the fetch URL again by adding another url encoded attribute `name`: append
  `&name=<searchQuery>` to the url. If the search query is an empty string, it will be ignored by
  the API, so don't worry about that.
- Now trigger the function `fetchCharacters` whenever a submit event happens.

> 💡 You might run into some bugs at this point. Think about how the page and max page index might
> have to change when you start searching for only subsets of all characters.

### Bonus: Refactoring your Code

You've done it: your app is working as expected. 🚀✨

However, we want to tidy up our code so that not everything is written in a single javascript file.

- The next and prev button as well as the pagination and the search bar are currently hard coded in
  the `index.html`. Remove the HTML code and generate them via JavaScript. Use the respective
  JavaScript component files for that.
- The component functions should be called `createButton`, `createPagination`, and `createSearchBar`
  and should return the created elements.
- HINT: It is challenging to get the event listener functions right for these components. Use an
  extra input parameter `onClick` or `onSubmit` in your components.
- Use the create functions inside your `index.js` to generate the UI components. You'll need to
  specify the event listener callback functions here either as anonymous arrow functions or as named
  functions. Use them as the argument for `onClick` or `onSubmit`, respectively.
- Append the created components at the right places in your HTML. All container elements are already
  available in the `index.js`.

### Bonus: Style Your Project

Congratulations on getting your project up and running! Now, let's take it to the next level by adding some flair and personality through styling. The bonus feature focuses on enhancing the visual appeal of your page with creative design elements. Follow these steps to give your project that extra touch:

#### Step 1: Experiment with Colors and Fonts

Dare to be bold with your color palette and font choices. Explore combinations that complement each other and resonate with the theme of your project. Remember, a harmonious color scheme and well-chosen fonts contribute significantly to the overall aesthetic.

#### Step 2: Prioritize Legibility

While getting creative, ensure that your page remains easy to read and navigate. Legibility is key to a positive user experience. Maintain a good contrast between text and background, and choose font sizes that are comfortable for users to consume your content.

#### Step 3: Embrace Animation

Introduce dynamic elements to your project through animations. Whether it's subtle transitions or eye-catching effects, animations can bring your project to life. Consider using CSS animations or JavaScript libraries to achieve the desired visual impact.

#### Step 4: Consistency is Key

Maintain a consistent design language across your project. This includes keeping a uniform style for buttons, navigation elements, and other interactive components. Consistency creates a polished and professional appearance.

#### Step 5: Mobile Responsiveness

Don't forget about the mobile experience! Test your project on various devices to ensure that your styling adjustments look great on both desktop and mobile screens. Responsive design is crucial for reaching a wider audience.

#### Step 6: Get Feedback

Once you've implemented your styling enhancements, gather feedback from colleagues or friends. Fresh perspectives can provide valuable insights and help you fine-tune your design.

Remember, this bonus feature is all about expressing your creativity, so have fun with it! Feel free to push the boundaries, but always keep user experience in mind. Happy styling!
