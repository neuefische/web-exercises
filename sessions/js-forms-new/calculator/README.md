# Calculator

Build a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

Add the following functionality to the submit event handler:

- Use the values of the `numberA` and `numberB` inputs to perform the operation selected by the `operator` input on them. You can use the provided helper functions `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()` and `divide()`.
- Assign the result to the `result` variable.

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure to thoroughly test the addition operation, as it can have unexpected results.

> ðŸ’¡ You only have to touch the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) file.
