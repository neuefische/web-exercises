# React Nesting: Buttons and Children

For now, there is a `Button` component in the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) which is rendered several times.

Unfortunately, all buttons show the same text; supposing that different buttons do different things in an application, this is not really a reuseable component.

Let's use the `children` prop to make the component more flexible!

## Task

Switch to the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) file and

1. in the `Button` component, receive the `children` prop as parameter; make sure to destructure it.
2. replace the "Click me!" text with the `children` prop (don't forget the curly braces `{}`).
3. in the `App` component, change the `Button` elements from being self-closing to have an opening and closing tag.
4. add text of your choice between the opening and closing tags of the Button elements (use different texts to see any difference in the browser!)

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you can now use the `children` prop to create really flexible components!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) file.

## Development

### CodeSandbox

Select the "Browser" tab to view this project.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to start the development server

> ðŸ’¡ This project requires a bundler. You can use `npm run start` to start the development server. You can then view the project in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code will **not** work for this project.
