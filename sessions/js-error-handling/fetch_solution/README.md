# Fetch

This application fetches information from the https://reqres.in API, but some buttons are trying to retrieve information from problematic URLs.

- [x] User 1 should work fine
- [x] User 2 should work fine
- [ ] User 99 does not exist, the response is not okay

Handle the corresponding exception in the JavaScript code and display an error message in the `<p class="error" data-js="error"></p>` element that includes the status code. 

> ðŸ’¡ We are expecting the API response to contain a status code of 404 if the user is not found.

**Bonus Challenge**

With the button "Invalid API Link", we do not receive the right content-type as response, this is already written into the `<p class="error" data-js="error"></p>` element like this:

```code
 Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
 ```

Can you be more specific and inform the user which content-type we received instead?

> ðŸ’¡ This is how you can get the content-type:

```js
const response = await fetch(url);
const contentType = response.headers.get("content-type");
```
