# Fetch

This application fetches information from the https://reqres.in API, but some buttons are trying to retrieve information from problematic URLs.

Handle the corresponding exceptions in the JS code and display an error message in the `.error` element accordingly.

Don't forget to clear the error if the fetch operation is successful!
