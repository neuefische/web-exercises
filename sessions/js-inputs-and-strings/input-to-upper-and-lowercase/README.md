# JS Inputs and Strings: Input to Uppercase and Lowercase

## Tasks

Convert the input value to lowercase when a second button is clicked.

- [ ] Add a second button to the `index.html`. It should have a down arrow (&darr;) as text content.
- [ ] Assign the second button to a variable.
- [ ] Add an event listener to the second button that converts the input value to lowercase when clicked.

Hint: Access the input value by using `.value` on the input element.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `index.html` and `./js/index.js` file.
