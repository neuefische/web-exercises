/*
Goal: We have one box and three sliders. We want the box to change according to the values of the sliders when the slider controls are moved.

Tasks:
- Add an event listener for every input element.
- If the slider control of inputColor is moved then the box should change its background color. Hint: You need to work with the hsl() functional notation for colors.
- If the slider control of inputRadius is moved then the border-radius of the box should change. If the control reaches the right end, then the box looks like a circle.
- If the slider control of inputRotation is moved then the box should rotate. Hint: You may need to work with the CSS property "transform" and a value that contains "rotate" and "deg".
- Hint: Instead of working with "classnames" you need to use the property "style".
