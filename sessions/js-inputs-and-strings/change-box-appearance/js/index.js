/*

Achieving the goal that the appearance of the box changes according to the values of the sliders controls (color, border radius, rotation)

– [ ] Add an event listener for every input element.
– [ ] If the slider control of inputColor is moved, the box change its background color. Hint: You need to work with the hsl() functional notation for colors.
– [ ]  If the slider control of inputRadius is moved then the border-radius of the box change. If the control reaches the right end, then the box looks like a circle.
– [ ]  If the slider control of inputRotation is moved then the box rotate. Hint: You may need to work with the CSS property "transform" and a value that contains "rotate" and "deg".

Hint: Instead of working with "classnames" you need to use the property "style".
