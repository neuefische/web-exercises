/*

Change the appearance of the box according to the values of the sliders (color, border radius, rotation)

– [ ] Add an event listener for each input element.
– [ ] When the slider control of inputColor is moved, change the background color of the box. Hint: You need to work with the hsl() functional notation for colors.
– [ ] When the slider control of inputRadius is moved, change the border radius of the box. If the control reaches the right end, make the box look like a circle.
– [ ] When the slider control of inputRotation is moved, rotate the box. Hint: You may need to work with the CSS property "transform" and a value that contains "rotate" and "deg".

Hint: You can work with the property "style", just like you worked with the property "classList".
