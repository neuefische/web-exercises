/* --- || Goal: Write a function that mimics the basic features of a vending machine. - */

/* --- ! Read all of the tasks carefully before starting to code ! --- */

/* 1. Write a function with the  name "vendingMachine". */

/* 2. The function should include a "drink" parameter. */

/* 3. In the function body, implement a console.log() that logs a string to the console 
including the "drink" parameter, informing the user that they have received their drink successfully.
The result should look something like this: "Here's your apple juice!" */

/* 4. Call your function with a drink of your choice and check the console whether 
your function words as intended. */

/* Hint: You may need to think about how to combine your drink parameter and the rest of the string
inside of your console.log() so that the result is a complete sentence. */

/* Question: What happens if you call the vendingMachine function without an argument? */

/* Bonus: 5. Find a way to assign a default value to a parameter in case the
function is called without an argument. This needs to be implemented when you're declaring the function,
not when you're calling it. */

/* --- Your Code Goes Below This Line --- */

/* If you're struggling, a good first step may be looking up the function syntax again. ... */
