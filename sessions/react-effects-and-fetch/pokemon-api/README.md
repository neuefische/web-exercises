# React Effects and Fetch: PokÃ©mon API

This app should load and display a list of PokÃ©mon.

## Task

Open the file [`src/components/PokemonList.js`](./src/components/PokemonList.js).

For now the PokÃ©mon are only fetched when we click the button below. Let's change the code so that our app does this automatically when the app renders.

- Remove the 'Load PokÃ©mon' button.
- Change the code below so that the `loadPokemon` function is only executed when the app component is rendered initially`

_Hint:_ Don't forget the dependency array!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`src/components/PokemonList.js`](./src/components/PokemonList.js) file.
