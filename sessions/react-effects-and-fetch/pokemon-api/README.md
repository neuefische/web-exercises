# React Effects and Fetch: Pokémon API

This app should load and display a list of Pokémon.

## Task

Open the file `./src/components/PokemonList.jsx`.

For now the Pokémon are only fetched when we click the button below. Let's change the code so that our app does this automatically when the app renders.

- Remove the 'Load Pokémon' button.
- Change the code below so that the `loadPokemon` function is only executed when the app component is rendered initially`

_Hint:_ Don't forget the dependency array!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./src/components/PokemonList.jsx` file.
