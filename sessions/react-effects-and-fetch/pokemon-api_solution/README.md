# React Effects and Fetch: Pokémon API

This app is designed to load and display a list of Pokémon.

## Tasks

Open the file `./src/components/PokemonList.jsx`.

Currently, the Pokémon are only fetched when the "Load Pokémon" button is clicked. Let’s update the code so that the app fetches Pokémon automatically when it first renders.

- Remove the "Load Pokémon" button.
- Modify the code so that the `loadPokemon` function is executed automatically when the component is initially rendered.`

_Hint:_ Don’t forget to include the dependency array!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./src/components/PokemonList.jsx` file.

## Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run dev` to start a development server and open the displayed URL in a browser.

### Scripts

You can use the following commands:
