# Backend Read: Products

In this challenge (and the upcoming ones), you'll create a fish shop.
You'll read data from your remote MongoDB using `mongoose` and display it in the frontend.

## Tasks

### Introduction

Run `npm run dev` and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser.

Have a look around:

- there is an overview page with all products and a details page for each of them;
- the data is taken from `lib/products.js`.

Your task is to refactor the app so that it fetches the data from a remote MongoDB.

### Read Products from Database

Creating a Database and Inserting Multiple Documents:

> ðŸ’¡ If you haven't completed this task during the Backend MongoDB session challenge, please follow these steps:

- Go to the "Deployments > Database" tab.
- Click "Browse Collections".
- Click "Create Database".
- In the dialog that appears, enter `fish-shop-database` as the `database name`.
- Enter `products` as the `collection name`.
- Click "Create" to create the new database and collection.
- Open the `fish-shop-database` database.
- Select the `products` collection.
- Click "Insert Document".
- A JSON editor will appear where you can insert these products.
- Change to the view `{}` and copy-paste the data from the `products.json` file.
- Download and extract the [resources](https://github.com/wd-bootcamp/web-exercises/blob/main/sessions/backend-read/products/README.md#resources).
- Copy-paste the data from the `products.json` file.
- Click "Insert".

Create a schema for the `Product` model in the `db/models` folder.

The schema should have the following fields:

- `name` (String)
- `description` (String)
- `price` (Number)
- `currency` (String)

At the root of the project, create a `.env.local` file which uses the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable and your MongoDB connection string.

- Copy and paste the following into the `.env.local` file: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/fish-shop?retryWrites=true&w=majority`.
- Replace `<user>` with your database username, `<password>` with your password and `<cluster-url>` with the URL of your cluster. You can find all of this information on the MongoDB Atlas website.

Switch to `pages/api/products/index.js`:

- Delete the import of `lib/products`.
- Import `dbConnect` from the `db/connect.js` file.
- Import the `Product` model.
- Make the `handler` function `async` and `await` the connection to the database.
- If the `request.method` is `GET`,

  - use the `Product` model to find all products and
  - return them as a response.

Switch to `components/ProductList` and adapt the frontend:

- replace all instances of `product.id` with `product._id`.

Check that it works:

- Reload `localhost:3000`; you should still see all fishes.

Switch to `pages/api/products/[id].js` and adapt it as explained above:

- To find a single product by its id, you can use the `Product` model and the `.findById()` method: `Product.findById(id)`.
- Delete `lib/products.js` because it is not used anymore.

Open the browser and check the details pages: they should now work as well!

### Bonus: Populate Reviews

Some of the products already have reviews which are stored in a second collection. Your task is to read from that collection and display the reviews on the right details page.

Open MongoDB Atlas and adapt your `fish-shop` database:

- Add a new collection called `reviews`; insert the data from `bonus-reviews.json`.
- Drop the `products` collection; recreate it with the same name, but now insert data from the `bonus-products.json` file.
  - Note: The data in `bonus-products.json` contain a `reviews` array with `ids` as a reference to the corresponding review in the `review` collection.

Create a schema for the `Review` model in the `db/models` folder.

The schema should have the following fields:

- `title` (String)
- `text` (String)
- `rating` (Number)

Update the `Product` schema to include a reference to the `Review` model:

- Import the `Review` model with `import "./Review";`
- Below the `currency` key, add a new line for the reviews; you want to define that it is an array of Object-Ids and has a reference to the `Review` schema like so: `reviews: { type: [Schema.Types.ObjectId], ref: "Review" },`

Switch to `pages/api/products/[id].js` and use the `.populate` method to integrate the reviews for each product:

- `const product = await Product.findById(id).populate("reviews");`

Finally, update the frontend to display the reviews:

- Switch to `components/Product/index.js`.
- Inside of the return statement, check whether the fetched `data` contain any reviews and if so, display them.
- Feel free to decide which part of the review data you want to display.

### Resources

You can find the fish shop data in [this folder](./resources/).

- The files are already in the correct structure for the app.
  - `products.json` contains the data for the first task, and
  - `bonus-products.json` and `bonus-reviews.json` contain the data for the bonus task.
- Import them into the correct collection of your remote MongoDB when you are asked to.

## Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run dev` to start a development server and open the displayed URL in a browser.

Use `npm run test` to run the tests.

### Scripts

You can use the following commands:

- `npm run dev` to start a development server
- `npm run build` to build the project
- `npm run start` to start a production server
- `npm run test` to run the tests
- `npm run lint` to run the linter
