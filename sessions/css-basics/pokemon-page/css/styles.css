/* The exercise starts here! Sometimes you may need to add a class attribute to some elements in your HTML structure, but otherwise, it won't be necessary to adjust the HTML to solve the tasks. */

/* ------- General Styles ------- */

/* Task 1: First, we want to adjust how the size of our elements is calculated in CSS. Do you know how to switch from "content-box" to "border-box"? */

/* Your solution */

/* Task 2: Let's work on some basic stylings that we want to apply to all elements in your code via inheritance. Which selector do we need for this? */

/* Add selector */
 {
  font-family: monospace;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
  background-color: LemonChiffon;
}

/* ------- Headings Part 1 ------- */

/* Task 3: Setting the line height to 1.5 is good for texts, for accessibility reasons, but it seems too much for headings. Let's change this by giving our headings a line height of 1.2. */

/* Your solution */

/* Task 4: Now we want to give our h1 element more styles to shine! Add the following styles by writing the correct declarations inside the next CSS rule:

- Change the background color to white
- Set the top margin to "0"
- Add padding of 10px
- Center the text of the heading
*/

.title {
  /* Your solution */
}

/* ------- Sections ------- */

/* Task 5: Our page consists of two sections containing information about why Pok√©mon are cool and what the favorite Pok√©mon are. Let's style these sections:

- Set a white background for our sections
- Add padding of 20px and margin of 10px
- A fancy add on: Add a solid 5px border with the color "orange" that is only visible on the left. Hint: Use "border-left". :)
- Bonus:  The left border of the second section, which contains a list of favorite Pok√©mon, should have the color "gold". Hint: You may need a second CSS rule.
*/

section {
  /* Your solution */
}

/* ------- Headings Part 2 ------- */

/* Task 6: The headings of our sections somehow look boring. Therefore, we want to change this:

- Add a border to the left and the right of the title only. The border should be 3px solid with the color "gold".
- There should be some space between the text and the border.
- The right border should end with the last character of the title. Hint: If you don't know how to do this, think about the display property.
- Bonus: The border color of the "Favorite Pok√©mon" title should be "orange". Hint: You may need another CSS rule.
*/

.subtitle {
  /* Your solution */
}

/* ------- List ------- */

/* Task 7: Finally, let's style our list with of favorite Pok√©mon. Which selector do we need? Also, add values for padding. */

/* Add selector */
 {
  list-style: "üß°";
  padding-left: /* Add value */ ;
}

/* Add selector */
 {
  padding-left: /* Add value */ ;
}

/* ------- The End -------- */

.image-fluid {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

/* Note: After finishing all tasks, this class should also work. The image should adjust its size flexibly according to the width of the viewport. */
