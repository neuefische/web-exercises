# CSS Basics: Pink Box

Let's get started with CSS! In this challenge you will create a pink box.

## Task

Check out the [index.html](./index.html) and the [styles.css](./css/styles.css) files.

- Fix the selector in the CSS file so that the predefined styles are applied to the div element. (Notice the font changing!)
- Insert styles for background color, text color and rounded edges as described in the comments in the CSS file.
- If you don't know the correct CSS properties try to find them on the internet. 🤓

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`css/styles.css`](./css/styles.css) file.
