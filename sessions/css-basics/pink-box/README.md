# CSS Basics: Pink Box

Let's get started with CSS! In this challenge you will create a pink box.

## Task

Check out the `./index.html` and the `./css/styles.css` files.

- Fix the selector in the CSS file so that the predefined styles are applied to the div element. (Notice the font changing!)
- Insert styles for background color, text color and rounded edges as described in the comments of the CSS file.
- If you don't know the correct CSS properties try to find them on the internet.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./css/styles.css` file.
