# CSS Basics: Pink Box

Let's get started with CSS! In this challenge, you will create a pink box.

## Tasks

Check out the `./index.html` and the `./css/styles.css` files.

- Fix the selector in the CSS file so that the predefined styles are applied to the `div` element. (Notice the font changing!)
- Insert styles for background color, text color, and rounded edges as described in the comments within the CSS file.
- If you don't know the correct CSS properties try searching for them online.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./css/styles.css` file.

## Development

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
