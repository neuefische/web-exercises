# CSS Basics - Different shapes

There are 4 `div` elements to style for this exercise:

1. `div` should be a square
2. `div` should have rounded edges
3. `div` should be a circle
4. `div` should be rotated 45deg

Also:

- Use the classes that are already attached to the elements
- Each div should have a unique color.
