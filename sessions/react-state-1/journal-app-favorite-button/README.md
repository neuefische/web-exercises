# React State: Journal App with Favorite Button State

In this challenge you will begin building a journal app. We will continue to build on this app throughout the next sessions. In this first part you are about to include our _favorite_ feature: a button that allows you to favorite an entry.

## Task

Locate the component with the favorite button. Here it's called `FavoriteButton`.

The component has an `isFavorite` boolean variable. This variable is used to determine if the star icon should be filled in or not.

- Make `isFavorite` a state variable.
- This state variable needs to be toggled when the user clicks the favorite button.
- Happy Hacking!
