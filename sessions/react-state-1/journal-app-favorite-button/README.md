# React State 1: Journal App with Favorite Button State

In this challenge, you will start building a journal app. We will continue to expand on this app in the upcoming sessions. In this first part, you will implement our _favorite_ feature: a button that allows you to mark an entry as a favorite.

## Tasks

Locate the component with the favorite button, called `FavoriteButton`.

The component currently uses an `isFavorite` boolean variable to determine whether the star icon should be filled or not.

- Convert `isFavorite` into a state variable.
- Ensure this state variable is toggled when the user clicks the favorite button.
- Happy hacking!
