# React State 2: Favourite Holiday

In the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) file, there is a form in which you can enter your favourite holiday and its respective date. Below the form, the submitted data should be displayed.

Unfortunately, the form is not working correctly. Let's fix that!

## Task

Switch to the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) file and refactor the `handleSubmit` function so that

1. the `App` component has access to the submitted data,
2. the submitted data is dynamically rendered in the respective output fields below the form.

You can use the following hints as guideline:

- Create a separate state for `holiday` and `date`.
- The `handleSubmit` function sets both states with its corresponding values. Do you remember how to access the values of the target fields?
- Don't forget to dynamically render the state variables in the output area.

## Bonus

When submitting the form, the form fields should be reset and the `holiday` field should be focussed.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) file.
