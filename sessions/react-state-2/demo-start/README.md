# React State 2: Demo Start

<!--

Describe the exercise in a few sentences. E.g.:

For now, the pokemon are only fetched when we click the button below. Let's change the code in such a way that our app does this automatically.

-->

## Task

<!--

Explaining the task in detail. E.g.:

Switch to the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) file and

1. remove the 'Load Pokemon' button.
2. fetch pokemon when the app is rendered.

You can use the following hints as guideline:

- The `loadPokemon` function should only be executed when the app is rendered.
- Don't forget the dependency array!

-->

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) file.
