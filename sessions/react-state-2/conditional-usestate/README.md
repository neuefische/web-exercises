# React State 2: Conditional useState

Click the button "Show Message" to render a hidden message to the UI. The App will crash because there is a bug in the code. You won't see the hidden message, but an error regarding the `useState` hook being conditionally rendered.

## Task

Switch to the `./src/App.js` file and make yourself familiar with the App.

After that, fix the error in the `./src/App.js` file. If you need a clue, search the internet for the eslint rule or the error message.

## Notes

- If you are wondering about your solution: yes, it is that easy!
- You only have to touch the `./src/App.js` file.
