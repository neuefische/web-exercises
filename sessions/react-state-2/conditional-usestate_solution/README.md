# React State 2: Conditional useState

Click the "Show Message" button to render a hidden message in the UI. However, the app will crash due to a bug in the code. Instead of seeing the hidden message, you'll encounter an error related to the `useState` hook being conditionally rendered.

## Tasks

Open the `./src/App.jsx` file and familiarise yourself with the structure and functionality of the app.

Fix the error in the `./src/App.jsx` file to prevent the crash. If you need help, search the internet for the eslint rule or the error message.

Ensure the hidden message is correctly displayed when the button is clicked.

## Notes

- If you're questioning your solution: yes, it really is that simple!
- You only have to touch the `./src/App.jsx` file.
