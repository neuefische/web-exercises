# Fetch Star Wars API and Log to Console

Fetching data is awesome, yet it can be frightening in the beginning. But don't worry – we are going to help you familiarize yourself with the syntax of fetch and all will be fine ;)

## Task

Have a look at the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) file: There is an `url` variable and an empty `fetchData()` function.

Inside of the `fetchData()` function, use the `url` variable to fetch data from the Star Wars API.

Log the fetched data to the console and play around with it:

- log the entire data object
- log different values of the data object
- Bonus: Can you log the eye color of R2-D2?

The following hints may guide you:

- make sure to wait for all asynchronous operations

Please switch to the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) file: May the force be with you!
