# Color Clue

This project offers a guessing game about colors: In the middle of the window, the name of a color is displayed. The user tries to choose the correct color with the help of the color input. Clicking the `Check` button reveals a percentage how close the user was right.

Unfortunately, the game does not work because the fetch is broken. Let's fix this!

## Task

Check out the [index.js](./js/index.js) file: There is a `fetchNewColor()` function which creates a random hex code.

Your task is to implement the fetch:

1. Use the autogenerated `hexCode` to fetch the information to this color from the api.
   1. Hint: `https://www.thecolorapi.com/id?hex=<your color code>`
   2. Inspect the incoming json with a console log!
   3. Don't forget to use a `try...catch` block!
2. In the received data, find the hex value and the color name. Update the variable `colorObject` with the respective data.
3. Update the textContent of the `nameDisplay` with the same name you stored in the colorObject.
4. Guess colors! ðŸŽ‰

Please switch to the [index.js](./js/index.js) file and start guessing!
