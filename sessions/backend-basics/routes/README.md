# Backend Basics: Routes

In this challenge, you will build a node server which responds depending on the url route opened on the browser.

## Task

> ðŸ’¡ This challenge includes tests. You can run them with `npm run test` and check your progress while working on the challenge.

Build a server that sends a different response depending on the url route:

- if the requested url is `/api/fish/1`, the response should be `"Shrimp"` and the status code should be `200`;
- if the requested url is `/api/fish/2`, the response should be `"Anemonefish"` and the status code should be `200`;
- for all other urls, the response should be `"Not found"` and the status code should be `404`.

Use the following hints as guideline:

- Switch to the [`server.js`](./server.js); use the `createServer` method provided by the `node:http` module to create a server.
- Inside of the function body of `createServer`, you can access the requested url with the help of the `request` object; it provides a `url` key which holds the url value.
  - Check the value of this `url` key to equal `/api/fish/1` or `/api/fish/2` and pass the respective value to `response.end()` as argument. Make sure to also set the correct status code using `response.statusCode =`.
- Export the server as a named export from the [`server.js`](./server.js) file.
- Open the [`index.js`](./index.js) file and import the server from the [`server.js`](./server.js) file.
- Call the `listen(8000)` method on the server to start listening on port 8000.

âœ¨ Your server now reacts differently depending on the requested url! Let's check that it works:

- Run `npm run start` to run the `index.js` file using `node`.
- Switch to your browser and open `localhost:8000/api/fish/1` as well as `localhost:8000/api/fish/2`.
- You should see the output you've declared as `response.end`.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`index.js`](./index.js) and [`server.js`](./server.js) file.

## Development

### CodeSandbox

This project is Node.js application. If it listens to any port (alÃ¡ `server.listen()`) CodeSandbox will open it in the "Browser" tab. Tests only seem to work locally.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run dev` to run the main JavaScript file using `node` in watch mode (restarts on file changes)
- `npm run start` to run the main JavaScript file using `node`
- `npm run test` to run the tests
- `npm run lint` to run the linter

> ðŸ’¡ Since this project is Node.js application you have to run it using `npm run start` or `npm run dev` and then check your browser on the port the app is listening to. Use `npm run test` to check your progress.
