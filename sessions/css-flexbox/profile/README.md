# CSS Flexbox: Profile

## Task

Utilize what you've learned about flexbox to complete the following tasks:

1. The profile section contains a level 2 heading, an image and an about text.

- [ ] The image should be centered.

2. The "Tech Stack" list needs to be polished.

- [ ] The list items are currently following the normal flow of the document, but they should be packed horizontally rather than stacked vertically.
- [ ] There should be a gap of at least 10px between every "Tech Stack" entry.
- [ ] The list items should wrap to the next line, if there is not enough horizontal space.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`css/styles.css`](./css/styles.css) file.
