# CSS Flexbox: Profile

## Tasks

Utilize what you've learned about flexbox to complete the following tasks:

1. **Profile Section Structure**

- The profile section contains a level 2 heading, an image and an about text.
- Center the image within this section.

2. **Tech Stack List Styling**

- Arrange the list items horizontally instead of stacking them vertically.
- Ensure there is a gap of at least 10px between each “Tech Stack” item.
- Allow list items to wrap to the next line when there isn’t enough horizontal space.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./css/styles.css` file.

## Development

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
