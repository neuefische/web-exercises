# CSS Flexbox: Navigation

## Tasks

- [ ] Open your `index.html` file.
- [ ] To create a flexbox container, determine which HTML element within the `<nav>` structure should have the `navigation__menu` class applied.
- [ ] Next, open your `styles.css` file.
- [ ] Make sure to include the `navigation__menu` class selector.
- [ ] Within the `navigation__menu` class selector, add the necessary properties to meet these requirements:
  - [ ] The links should be spaced horizontally, as far apart as possible.
  - [ ] The first link should align to the start, and the last link should align to the end.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `index.html` and `./css/styles.css` file.
