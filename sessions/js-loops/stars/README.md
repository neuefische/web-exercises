# JS Loops: Stars

Let's build an awesome interactive 5-star rating scale! The goal is to display filled/empty stars depending on the user input. A click on a star should fill all stars up to the clicked one and leave all others empty.

## Task

### Part 1: Render Stars

Start by rendering 5 empty stars in the `starContainer`. For that, switch to `./js/index.js` and write the function `renderStars`:

- Use a for loop inside the function to repeat the following code five times.
  💡 Start the loop with the value 1, not with 0
- Inside the for loop, create an image element and set the "src" attribute to the path of the empty star image ("assets/star-empty.svg")
- append the star to the `starContainer`.

### Part 2: Change the number of filled stars

Now we want to render a certain number of filled stars, depending on the argument given to the function:

- Add a new parameter to the `renderStars` function, named `filledStars`. Expect its value to be a number.
- Inside the loop, as you create each star, use the value of `filledStars` to decide if a filled or an empty star should be created.
  💡 Use the counter variable of the for loop to check which star is currently being created (the first, second, third...)
- Depending on whether a filled or an empty star should be created, set the `src` of the image element to the filled or empty star image URL.
- Change the code that calls `renderStars`: pass in a number between 0 and 5 as an argument, and see if it works as expected!

### Part 3: Implement user input

By now, the number of filled stars is set when calling the `renderStars` functions with a number argument.
However, we want the user to decide how many stars should be filled. Let's add a "click" event listener to every star to re-render the stars inside the container!

- Before appending the star element to the `starContainer`, add a "click" event listener to it.
- Inside the event listener, re-render the stars by calling `renderStars`. Pass the correct number to that function in order to render the correct number of filled stars.
  💡 Your loop counter variable might help you!

You are done! 🎉 Five stars to you! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./js/index.js` file.
