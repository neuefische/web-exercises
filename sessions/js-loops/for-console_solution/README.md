# JS Loops: `for` Loop and `console.log()`

Let’s be clear: Loops can seem intimidating at first. But don’t worry! We’ll guide you through the syntax, and soon they’ll feel much more approachable.

## Task

Use a `for` loop to log the numbers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) in the console.

Make sure your `for` loop includes:

- An internal counter variable
- A condition to be met by the counter variable
- A rule for how the counter variable increments

Switch to the `./index.js` file to start coding!
