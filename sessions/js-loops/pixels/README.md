# Pixels

In this challenge we go one dimension higher and will draw pixels from a "2d" array.

## Task

Use the color values in the array `pixelValues` to create "pixel" elements and append them to the `canvas` element.

- use `for` loops to generate the pixel elements
- pixels should be a `div` element with the class `pixel` and the background color set to respective color from the `pixelValues` array.
- You can append all pixels directly to the canvas, no need for extra row grouping etc.
- Hint: The colors are stored in Arrays inside another Array. How can you access these values with for loops?

Switch to the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) file and make something great happen!
