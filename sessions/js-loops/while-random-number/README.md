# `while` loop

In contrast to for loops, a `while` loop does not need to know how many times it will run in advance. It will just run if a condition is met, and will stop otherwise.

Let's create a couple of random numbers and stop if they grow too big!

## Task

Looking at the [index.js](index.js), there are two variables:

- `number`: a random number, set in each iteration of the while loop
- `count`: the number of iterations, increased by 1 everytime the while loop runs

Create a `while` loop that

- runs if `number` is less or equal to 0.9,
- increments `count` by 1 in each iteration
- sets `number` to a random number; you can use `Math.random()` here.

If you're done, test your loop by refreshing the browser several times and watching the console!

Please switch to the [index.js](index.js) file and be random!
