# For...of to create a list

We can use loops to iterate through an array and do some stuff with each item. Let's create HTML elements with the help of `for...of` and a given array!

## Task

Looking at the `./js/index.js` , there is

- an `ol` created and appended to the document
- a string array stored to a variable called `programmingLanguages`.

For each array item, create a list item for the ordered list with its value as visible text. Use the `for...of` loop.

The following hints may guide you:

- What was the property to set the text of an HTML element again?
- Don't forget to append each list item!

Please switch to the `./js/index.js` file and be a navigator!
