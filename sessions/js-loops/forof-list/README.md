# JS Loops: Creating a List

We can use loops to iterate through an array and perform actions on each item. Let's create HTML elements with the help of a `for...of` loop and a given array!

## Task

In `./js/index.js`, you'll find:

- An `ol` element that’s been created and appended to the document.
- A string array stored in a variable called `programmingLanguages`.

Your task is to create a list item for each array item and add it to the ordered list. Each list item should display the value of the current array item. Use a `for...of` loop to accomplish this.

The following hints may guide you:

- Do you remember the property for setting the text of an HTML element?
- Be sure to append each list item to the ordered list.

Switch to the `./js/index.js` to begin!

## Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

> Alternatively you can use the Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code to view this project.  
> Select the HTML file you want to view, press <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>P</kbd>, search for `Live Preview: Show Preview` and confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Use `npm run test` to run the tests.

### Scripts

You can use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to start a development server
- `npm run test` to run the tests
- `npm run lint` to run the linter
