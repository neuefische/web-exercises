# For...in Loop and Select Navigation

We can use loops for creating HTML elements. In this Codesandbox, the website needs a select input with language options and a navigation bar. Let's do this with the help of `for...in`!

## Task

### Part 1: Creating a Select Input

Looking at the `./js/index.js` , there is a `languages` object with some key-value pairs. Additionally, a `select` element with the name "languages" is created and appended to the main element.

Iterate through the `languages` object using `for...in` and add the `option` elements for this dropdown menu.

The following hints may guide you:

- Create one `option` element for each entry in `languages`.
- For each option, set its `value` and `textContent` to the value of each entry in `languages`. You will need bracket notation, e.g. `languages[myIteratorName]`.
- Don't forget to append each option!

### Part 2: Creating a Navigation Bar

Before we create a navigation bar, let's have a look what's already there in `./js/index.js` :

- There is a `nav` object with the keys "home", "about", and "contact".
- Each value is an object containing an "href" and "text" key and a string value.
- A `nav` and `ul` element is created and appended to the `main` element.

Your task is to fill this list with list items and anchor tags; as content, use the `nav` object which you can access with a `for...in` loop.

Use the following hints as a guideline:

- Write a `for...in` loop for the `nav` object.
- In each iteration,
  - create a list item and an anchor tag
  - set the anchor tag's `href` and `textContent` properties to the relevant values of the `nav` object; you want to use bracket notation with your iterator variable
  - append your created items accordingly.

Please switch to the `./js/index.js` file and be a navigator!

## Development

### Local Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
