# For Loop and `console.log()`

To be clear: Loops can be frightening at the beginning. But don't worry, we are going to make you familiar with the syntax and it will be fine ;)

## Task

Log the numbers from 0 to 100 (including) into the console. Use a for loop.

Make sure your for loop has

- an internal counter variable
- a criterion to be met by the counter variable
- a rule how the counter variable is increased

Please switch to the [index.js](index.js) file to start counting!
