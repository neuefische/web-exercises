# For Loop and `console.log()`

To be clear: Loops can be frightening at the beginning. But don't worry, we are going to make you familiar with the syntax and it will be fine ;)

## Task

Log the numbers from 0 to 100 (including) into the console. Use a for loop.

Make sure your for loop has

- an internal counter variable
- a criterion to be met by the counter variable
- a rule how the counter variable is increased

Please switch to the [`index.js`](./index.js) file to start counting!

## Development

### CodeSandbox

This project is JavaScript only so there is nothing to view in the "Browser" tab. Please select the "Tests" tab to check your progress.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to run the main JavaScript file using `node`
- `npm run test` to run the tests once
- `npm run lint` to run the linter

> ðŸ’¡ Since this project is JavaScript only there is nothing to preview in the browser. Use `npm run test` to check your progress or `npm run start` to run the code.
