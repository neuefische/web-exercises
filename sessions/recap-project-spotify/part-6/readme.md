# React Recap Project - Part 6

## Features

The saved albums are persisted in the local storage of the browser. The albums are saved even after reloading the page.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When reloading the page, the 'savedAlbumIds' state is not lost but the saved albums are unchanged.

## Notes

- In this part you practice how to use packages or libraries in your projects.
- You can use the `use-local-storage-state` package for saving a state in the localStorage. Visit [the documentation](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) to learn how to use the hook.
