# Recap Project 4: Weather & Activities App

In this recap project, you'll work together with a partner: you'll create an app that fetches a
weather object from an API and conditionally picks activities from a list to display as suggestions.
You'll need to implement a feature that allows you to add more suggestions to the list of activities
and also allows you to delete suggestions.

The way this app is going to handle data is a basic example of CRUD operations. CRUD stands for
Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are the main features every app needs.

Please note: the focus of this challenge is on React logic (and not on design), which is why the
wireframes only have a very basic styling. Due to the given timeframe, you can consider styling the
app as bonus task at the very end ;).

## Pair Programming

Built this project together with a partner in pair programming:

- share a single workstation (one screen, keyboard, and mouse);
- one partner is the "driver" and writes the code;
- the other is called "navigator" and focusses more on the overall direction of the application;
- set a timer (30 minutes is a good amount of time) and change roles regularly.

## API

We are going to fetch all necessary information about the weather from a REST API specifically
designed for this project. Check out the [Weather API](https://example-apis.vercel.app/). You find
all the information you need in the docs.

## Template

There is no template or starter code, so you can start completely fresh! Please use
[`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to create a new project.

The sequence of the tasks described below is a good example for how to _start_ writing an app.

> ðŸ’¡ Because we need data to work with, we usually want to start with the C in CRUD. In this
> instance, adding a form that handles creating the data for our activities.

## Tasks

### Add Activity Form

Being able to create new data is a good starting point for an app, so the first step is to create a
form component to add a new activity.

- Clean the app from everything which you don't need for a fresh start.
- Write a `Form` component which
  - contains a heading
  - has two input fields (name of activity, checkbox whether it is a good- or bad-weather activity)
    with appropriate labels and
  - a submit button;
  - it receives a prop called `onAddActivity`.
- Handle the submit event:

  - Extract the submitted data as an object with the keys `name` and `isForGoodWeather` and their
    respective values.

    - Hint: To get the boolean value of a checkbox, use `.checked`.

  - Call `onAddActivity` and pass it the data object as argument.

- After submitting, reset the form and focus the first input field.
- Switch to the App.js and
  - create a state for `activities`,
  - write a function `handleAddActivity` which accepts a new activity object as parameter and adds
    this object to the `activities` state
  - please add a unique id to every new activity object; you can use
    [uid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uid) to do so.
- Pass `handleAddActivity` to the Form component; make sure to use the correct prop name.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you can now add new activities, including whether they can be done in good or
bad weather!

### List Component

By now, you can add new activities, but they are not yet displayed. Let's fix this.

- Write a `List` component which renders a list with list items for each activity in the
  `activities` state.
- Make the state persistent in local storage.

### Filtering the List

Currently, the list displays all activities, regardless of whether they are good or bad weather
activities. The main purpose of the app, however, is to show activities depending on the current
(good / bad) weather fetched from an API, so the list needs to be filtered.

- In the App.js, add a variable `const isGoodWeather = true`.
  - Note: For reasons of simplicity (i.e. it will be replaced in the next task anyway), we will use
    a hard coded variable to imitate good or bad weather for now.
- Filter the `activities` for those whose key `isForGoodWeather` is equal to the global
  `isGoodWeather` variable.
- Instead of all `activities`, pass the filtered activities to the `List` component.
- In the List component, add a headline depending on the global `isGoodWeather` variable.

### Fetch API

Refactor the code so that the "random" weather does not depend on a variable you set yourself, but
on the answer from our weather API.

- Replace the global `isGoodWeather` variable from the previous task with a new state for `weather`.
- Fetch the [weather API](https://example-apis.vercel.app/) on initial render only.
  - The `weather` state should equal the response you receive from the API.
  - Advanced note: The API has some more specific endpoints to test your application.
- In the App.js, add a heading to display the condition emoji and the temperature.

### Delete an Item

- In the List component, add a delete button for each list item.
- The List component needs to receive a new prop called `onDeleteActivity`;
  - pass it to the delete button as onClick prop;
  - pass the activity's id to `onDeleteActivity` as argument.
- In the App.js, write a function `handleDeleteActivity`, which accepts an id as parameter. The
  function should filter the `activities` state and keep all objects except the one with the given
  id.
  - Pass `handleDeleteActivity` to the List component as `onDeleteActivity` prop.

### Bonus: Fetch on Intervall

Fetching weather only on initial render is not really useful to stay up-to-date. Refactor your code
so that the fetch is done every 5 seconds. Make sure to clear the timer when the component unmounts.
