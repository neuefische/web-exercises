# React with Local Storage: Journal App with Local Storage

Make your journal entries persistent by saving them to local storage.

## Task

Install the [`use-local-storage-state`](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) package and use it to make the journal entries persistent.

> ğŸ’¡ Does it make sense to also put the `filter` state into local storage? What are the differences to the user experience?
