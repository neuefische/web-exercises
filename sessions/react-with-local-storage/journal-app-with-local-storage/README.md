# React with Local Storage: Journal App with Local Storage

Make your journal entries persistent by saving them to local storage.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use this template as a starting point. But if you are far enough along with your own Journal App, please use that instead.

## Task

Install the [`use-local-storage-state`](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) package and use it to make the journal entries persistent.

> ðŸ’¡ Does it make sense to also put the `filter` state into local storage? What are the differences to the user experience?

## Development

### CodeSandbox

Select the "Browser" tab to view this project.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to start the development server
- `npm run build` to create a production build
- `npm run test` to run the tests in watch mode (if available)

> ðŸ’¡ This project requires a bundler. You can use `npm run start` to start the development server. You can then view the project in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code will **not** work for this project.
