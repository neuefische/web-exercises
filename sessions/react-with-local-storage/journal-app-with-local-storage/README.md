# React with Local Storage: Journal App with Local Storage

Make your journal entries persistent by saving them to local storage.

## Tasks

Install the [`use-local-storage-state`](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) package and use it to make the journal entries persistent.

> 💡 Does it make sense to also put the `filter` state into local storage? What are the differences to the user experience?

## Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run dev` to start a development server and open the displayed URL in a browser.

### Scripts

You can use the following commands:

- `npm run dev` to start a development server
- `npm run build` to build the project
