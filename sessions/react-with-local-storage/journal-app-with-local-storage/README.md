# React with Local Storage: Journal App with Local Storage

Make your journal entries persistent by saving them to local storage.

> 💡 You can use this template as a starting point. But if you are far enough along with your own Journal App, please use that instead.

## Task

Install the [`use-local-storage-state`](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) package and use it to make the journal entries persistent.

> 💡 Does it make sense to also put the `filter` state into local storage? What are the differences to the user experience?
