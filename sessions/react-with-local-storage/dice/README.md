# React with Local Storage: Dice ðŸŽ²

This dice rolling app rolls a die (d6 = six sided die). Now you want to show recent dice rolls in a list and store them in local storage.

## Task

### Lifting State Up

Look at the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) and [`src/components/D6Button/index.js`](./src/components/D6Button/index.js) files.

Lift up the `rolls` state into the `App` component. Pass the derived `currentRollValue` variable down to the `D6Button` and wire up a `onClick` handler to call the `handleRoll` function via props. Make sure everything still works as expected.

Now pass the `rolls` down to the `History` component as well (replace `rolls={[]}`).

> âœ¨ You should now see the list of recent rolls in the History component.

### Local Storage

Install `use-local-storage-state` via npm. Import the `useLocalStorageState` hook and use it to store the `rolls` in local storage.

> âœ¨ You now have a persistent dice rolling app!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`src/App.js`](./src/App.js) and [`src/components/D6Button/index.js`](./src/components/D6Button/index.js) files.
