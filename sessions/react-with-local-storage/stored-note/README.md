# React with Local Storage: Stored Note

The contents of this notepad are lost when you refresh the page. Make it persistent by saving the contents to local storage.

## Task

Switch to the `./src/App.js` file and replace both `useState` hooks with `useLocalStorageState` hooks to make the notepad and the font selection persistent. The `use-local-storage-state` package is already installed. Import it like this:

```js
import useLocalStorageState from "use-local-storage-state";
```

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./src/App.js` file.
