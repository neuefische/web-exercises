# I like Animals, don't I? (JS Unit Testing)

This exercise offers first steps into the world of software testing. It's quite similar to the tests you have seen during the lecture, so don't be afraid ;)

## Task

In this exercise, you will encounter the following tasks:

- If the name argument equals "cat", return `"I really like cats!"`
- If there is a name argument, return `"I like [animalPlural]!"`
  - Note: Please don't bother with irregular plurals for now.
- If there is no argument given, return `"I do not like animals at all."`

Please switch to the [index.js](index.js) file to start the exercises. You will find the exact tasks there.

## Notes

- If you want to check whether you solved the tasks correctly, open the "Tests" tab of Codesandbox.
- You only have to touch the `js/index.js` file.
