# I like Animals, don't I? (JS Unit Testing)

This exercise offers first steps into the world of software testing. It's quite similar to the tests you have seen during the lecture, so don't be afraid ;)

## Task

Have a look at the [index.test.js](index.test.js): there are predefined tests for the `getAnimal()` function.

Read them very carefully to understand what the `getAnimal()` function is supposed to do. After doing so, your task is to implement the function so that all tests pass.

Please switch to the [index.js](index.js) file to start and start liking animals!

## Notes

- Make sure to run `npm install` first.
- You can run the test via the command `npm run test:watch`
- You only have to touch the [index.js](index.js) file.
