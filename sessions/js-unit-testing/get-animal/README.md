# I like Animals, don't I? (JS Unit Testing)

This exercise offers first steps into the world of software testing. It's quite similar to the tests you have seen during the lecture, so don't be afraid ;)

## Task

Have a look at the [`index.test.js`](index.test.js): there are predefined tests for the `getAnimal()` function.

Read them very carefully to understand what the `getAnimal()` function is supposed to do. After doing so, your task is to implement the function so that all tests pass.

Please switch to the [`index.js`](index.js) file to start working (and liking animals)!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`index.js`](index.js) file.

## Development

### CodeSandbox

This project is JavaScript only so there is nothing to view in the "Browser" tab. Please select the "Tests" tab to check your progress.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to run the main JavaScript file using `node`
- `npm run test` to run the tests once
- `npm run lint` to run the linter

> ðŸ’¡ Since this project is JavaScript only there is nothing to preview in the browser. Use `npm run test` to check your progress or `npm run start` to run the code.
