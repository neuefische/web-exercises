# Testing Math Functions

This exercise offers first steps into the world of software testing. It's quite similar to the tests you have seen during the lecture, so don't be afraid ;)

## Task

Have a look at the [`index.js`](index.js): there are four functions, `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`.

Read them very carefully to understand what these functions are supposed to return.

Create an `index.test.js` file and import the functions from the [`index.js`](./index.js). Implement tests to make sure that the functions work properly.

Your tests should cover the following criteria (write one test case for each of them):

- `add()`

  - returns 5 if called with add(2, 3)
  - returns a negative value if the greater argument is negative (Hint: use the matcher `toBeLessThan()`)
  - returns a value close to 0.3 if called with add(0.1, 0.2) (Hint: use the matcher `toBeCloseTo()`)

- `subtract()`

  - returns 10 if called with subtract(15, 5)
  - returns a negative value if the second argument is greater than the first one (use `toBeLessThan()` again)

- `multiply()`

  - returns 8 if called with multiply(2, 4)
  - returns a negative value if only the first argument is negative
  - returns a negative value if only the second argument is negative
  - returns a positive value if called with two negative arguments

- `divide()`
  - returns 3 if called with divide(9, 3)
  - returns "You should not do this!" if called with 0 as second argument

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `index.test.js` file.

## Development

### CodeSandbox

This project is JavaScript only so there is nothing to view in the "Browser" tab. Please select the "Tests" tab to check your progress.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to run the main JavaScript file using `node`
- `npm run test` to run the tests once
- `npm run test:watch` to run the tests in watch mode
- `npm run lint` to run the linter

> ðŸ’¡ Since this project is JavaScript only there is nothing to preview in the browser. Use `npm run test:watch` to check your progress or `npm run start` to run the code.
