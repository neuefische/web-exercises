# Forms and A11y

This Codesandbox offers a form where the user can submit some information.

Unfortunately, the form is not accessible because there are some issues in the HTML.

## Task:

Switch to the [`index.html`](./index.html) file and make the form accessible!

## Questions to guide you:

- How do you connect a form with its headline?
- How do you link a description to a specific <fieldset> element?
- Do all interactive fields have their own label?
- Are all labels linked to their interactive fields with the help of the correct attributes?
- Does this connections works correctly?
  - To check this, go to your browser and click on the label; the corresponding input field should now be focused.
  - If not, did we make a spelling mistake?
- Do we need the given placeholder?
