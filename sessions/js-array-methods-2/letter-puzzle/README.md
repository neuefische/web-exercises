# JS Array Methods 2: Employee Data Puzzle

This challenge tasks you with navigating a large dataset of over 500 employees, utilizing JavaScript array methods to uncover and resolve a letter puzzle.

## Task

### Instructions

- Proceed to `./js/index.js`. Each question in the challenge corresponds to a part of the puzzle, requiring the use of a particular array method.
- Test your answers using `console.log()` and track your progress in the console and browser preview.
