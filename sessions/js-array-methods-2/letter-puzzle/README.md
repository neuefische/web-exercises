# JS Array Methods 2: Letter Puzzle

Imagine you work in a very huge company with 500+ employees. All employees are stored in an array. Finding detailed information about specific employees could be a hard job. Fortunately you know some array methods that can help you. 

## Task

First get familiar with the data. You can find the employees array here: `/utils/data.js`. In the browser preview you can see a letter puzzle. You can fill it step by step by answering the following questions. Replace the `null` with an appropriate array method. You can use `console.log` to check what you get. 

Switch to the  `./js/index.js`  file, open the console and browser preview and make something great happen!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./js/index.js` file.
