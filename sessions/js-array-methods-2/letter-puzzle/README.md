# JS Array Methods 2: Letter Puzzle

Imagine you work in a very huge company with 500+ employees. All employees are stored in an array. Finding detailed information about specific employees could be a hard job. Fortunately you know some array methods that can help you. 

## Task

First get familiar with the data. You can find the employees array here: `/utils/data.js`. In the preview (i.e. Live Server) you can see a letter puzzle. You can fill it step by step by answering the following 18 questions. Use `array-methods` and `console.log's` for this purpose. Once you found the right answer, fill the corresponding letter into the textContent of that exercise (i.e. `letter8.textContent="X"`). The first question is already solved as an example.

Hint: Make sure, not to manipulate the original array - this could lead to wrong answers in following questions!


Switch to the  `./js/index.js`  file, open the console and make something great happen!


## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./js/index.js` file.
