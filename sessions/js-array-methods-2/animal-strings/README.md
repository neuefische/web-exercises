# Array Methods 2: A simple String Array

This codesandbox offers a some exercises to recap some enhanced array methods. Let's dive directly into it!

## Task

In the [index.js](index.js) file, there is an `animalStrings` array with - guess what? - animal names as strings.

Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `hippoExists`). They all are initialized with `null`.

And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code such that the variables have a value corresponding to their name. Use the following methods to achieve this goal:

- `Array.includes()`
- `Array.find()`
- `Array.findIndex()`
- `Array.sort()`
- `Array.some()`
- `Array.every()`
- `Array.reduce()`

Additionally, you will need:

- `String.startsWith()`
- `String.endsWith()`

You will find some hints as comments.

Switch to the [index.js](index.js) file and work with animals!
