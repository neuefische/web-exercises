# Array Methods 2: A simple String Array

This CodeSandbox offers some exercises to recap some advanced array methods. Let's dive in!

## Task

In the [`index.js`](./index.js) file, there is an `animalStrings` array with - guess what? - animal names as strings.

Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `hippoExists`). They all are initialized with `null`.

And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code such that the variables have a value corresponding to their name. Use the following methods to achieve this goal:

- `Array.includes()`
- `Array.find()`
- `Array.findIndex()`
- `Array.sort()`
- `Array.some()`
- `Array.every()`
- `Array.reduce()`

Additionally, you will need:

- `String.startsWith()`
- `String.endsWith()`

You will find some hints as comments.

Switch to the [`index.js`](./index.js) file and work with animals!

## Notes

- If you want to check whether you solved the tasks correctly, open the "Tests" tab of Codesandbox.

## Development

### CodeSandbox

This project is JavaScript only so there is nothing to view in the "Browser" tab. Please select the "Tests" tab to check your progress.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to run the main JavaScript file using `node`
- `npm run test` to run the tests once
- `npm run lint` to run the linter

> ðŸ’¡ Since this project is JavaScript only there is nothing to preview in the browser. Use `npm run test` to check your progress or `npm run start` to run the code.
