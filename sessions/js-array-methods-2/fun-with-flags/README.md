# Fun with Flags

In this challenge you will learn how to use the array method find and how it differes from filter.

## Tasks

### 1. Find One Matching Country

Inside the event listener, use the `find` method to find the country in the countries array which name starts with the search string.

> ðŸ’¡ Strings have a method `startsWith(string)`, which might be helpful.

> ðŸ’¡ Each contry in the array as a name attribute.

### 2. Find All Matching Countries

Change the method from `find` to `filter`, to filter the countries to those which name starts with the search string. Remember to change the variable name from `foundCountry` to `foundCountries` to reflect that it now is an array.

Adapt the rendering of the found countries. You'll need to loop over the array of `foundCountries`. Which array method can you use for that?
