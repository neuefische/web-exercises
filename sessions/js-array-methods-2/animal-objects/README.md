# Array Methods 2: An Array with Objects

This CodeSandbox offers some more exercises to recap some advanced array methods. Let's dive in!

## Task

In the `./index.js` file, there is an `animals` array with - guess what? - animals. Each animal is an object with some key-value-pairs.

Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `firstAnimalStartingWithLetterG`). They all are initialized with `null`.

And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code such that the variables have a value corresponding to their name. Use the following methods to achieve this goal:

- `Array.includes()`
- `Array.find()`
- `Array.findIndex()`
- `Array.sort()`
- `Array.some()`
- `Array.every()`
- `Array.reduce()`
- `Array.reverse()`

Additionally, at some point you will need:

- `Array.filter()`
- `Array.map()`
- `String.startsWith()`

You will find some hints as comments.

Switch to the `./index.js` file and work with animals!
