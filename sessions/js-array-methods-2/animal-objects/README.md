# Array Methods 2: An Array with Objects

This codesandbox offers a some exercises to recap some enhanced array methods. Let's dive directly into it!

## Task

In the [index.js](index.js) file, there is an `animals` array with - guess what? - animals. Each animal is an object with some key-value-pairs.

Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `firstAnimalStartingWithLetterG`). They all are initialized with `null`.

And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code such that the variables have a value corresponding to their name. Use the following methods to achieve this goal:

- `Array.includes`()`
- `Array.find`()`
- `Array.findIndex`()`
- `Array.sort`()`
- `Array.some`()`
- `Array.every`()`
- `Array.reduce`()`
- `Array.reverse`()`

Additionally, at some point you will need:

- `Array.filter`()`
- `Array.map`()`
- `String.startsWith`()`

You will find some hints as comments.

Switch to the [index.js](index.js) file and work with animals!
