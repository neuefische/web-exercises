# Relay Race 🏃‍♀️

## Task

Animate the relay runners along the race track using the `animateRunner()` function.

The first runner can start immediately after the "🏁 Start race" button was clicked.

The second runner should start after the first runner has reached them (in other words: when the first animation has finished).

The same goes for the third runner in relation to the second one.

Switch to the `./js/index.js` file and update the code in the click handler!

## Notes

- You only need to touch the `./js/index.js` file.
