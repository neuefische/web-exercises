# Relay Race 🏃‍♀️

## Task

Animate the relay runners along the race track using the `animate()` function.

The first runner can start immediately once the "🏁 Start race" button was clicked.

The second runner should only start after the they have been reached by the first one (the first animation has finished).

The same should be true for the third runner in relation to the second one.

Switch to the [index.js](./js/index.js) file and update the code in the click handler!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `js/index.js` file.
