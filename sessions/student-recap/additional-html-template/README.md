# HTML additional template

## Task

- Open the [`index.html`](./index.html) file and let's have a look at a basic HTML structure and apply it to different scenarios.

## Notes

We have:

- a `<head>` section with the `<title>` (_not_ visible in the browser body);
- a `<body>` containing an `<header>`, a `<main>` and a `<footer>`;
- the `<header>` has a title, a picture, a descriptive paragraph and a
    navigation;
- the `<footer>` has just a (fake) copyright info;
- the `<main>` contains three `<section>`s;
- each `<section>` has a title, one or more paragraphs, and if needed a list of additional information.

Try to draft a homepage for:

- a cinema / theater;
- a restaurant;
- a music band/ favorite singer;
- a public administration office.

Decide first the information you'll need / want to show (pencil and paper go a
long way), then work on the HTML.
