# Template to practice reading error messages of linters

This repository is a simple template for the web development students. It is a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript template without a bundler.

## How to setup?

- Turn this template into your personal repo
- Clone this repository
- Run: `npm install`

## Exercise

The buttons in the list items don't seem to be working. Follow the instructions which are printed by the linters and fix all the issues. The goal is to make the buttons toggle again.

- Use `npm run test` to see which errors are found in the code.
- Use `npm run fix` to find errors and format your code

Inspect the package.json to see more commands to run the linters individually.
