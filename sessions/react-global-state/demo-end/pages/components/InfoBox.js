              A counter is a piece of furniture. Counters consist of a counter
              top, a raised surface which can be used to place objects or serve
              food on them. Similar to a table, counters are typically raised
              platforms, but are often embedded into flooring as fixed
              installations. Chairs or stools are often arranged around a
              counter for seating purposes.
