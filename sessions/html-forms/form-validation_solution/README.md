# HTML Form Validation

This challenge offers a form where the user can submit a complaint.

In order to process the complaint, the company needs certain information.

## Tasks

Make sure that the user submits all relevant information in a correct format.

Use the following guidelines:

- First and last name are required and are allowed to have at least 4 and up to 30 characters.
- The user needs to be at least 14 years old.
- We need a correct email adress (i.e. including an `@` symbol) for contacting the user.
- It's necessary that the user has read the terms of service and agrees to them.

Switch to the [`index.html`](./index.html) file and validate the form in the mentioned way!

> ðŸ’¡ By default, the browser reloads a page when a form is submitted. This behavior is turned off in this challenge with a little bit of JavaScript (see `js/index.js`). We will learn about this in more detail in the session JS Forms.

## Development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following command:

- `npm run lint` to run the linter
