/*
Exercise: Form submit

- Add an event listener for the submit event of the form.
- Get the data of the different input elements, put it in an object and push it into the data array that's already defined for you in the exercise.
- After every submit, reset the form so all the inputs are empty again.

Important!: Make sure you cancel the default browser behaviour of the formState.
