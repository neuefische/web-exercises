# Handle Form Submit

Use JavaScript to react to the form submission.

Log all form data (in object form) into the console in the submit event handler.

Make sure the form is reset and the First Name input is focused after submission.

> 💡 You only have to touch the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) file.

## Bonus: Calculate and log the age-badness-sum 🤷‍♀️

The formula is: `age + badness`

Log to the console _(replace the values between the quotes)_:

> The age-badness-sum of "firstName" is "age-badness-sum"
