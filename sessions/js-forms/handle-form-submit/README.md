# Handle Form Submit

Use JavaScript to react to the form submission.

Log all form data (in object form) into the console in the submit event handler.

> 💡 You only have to touch the `js/index.js` file.

## Bonus: Calculate and log the age-badness-sum 🤷‍♀️

The formula is: `age + badness`

Log to the console _(replace the values between the quotes)_:

> The age-badness-sum of "firstName" is "age-badness-sum"
