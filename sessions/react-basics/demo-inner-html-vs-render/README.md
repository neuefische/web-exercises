# innerHTML vs. React Render Demo

This demo shows how a react render compares to a `.innerHTML` assignment.

## Notes

- Open the [`index.js`](./src/index.js) file to present this demo.
- `innerHTML` updates the whole div, while React only updates the counter text.
  - This makes the `innerHTML` approach unusable (because the textfield is recreated every second)
  - React is more efficient and faster here (because it only updates one text element) even though it doesn't matter on this small example
