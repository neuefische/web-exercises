# product-teaser

## Task

This exercise includes an example of a product teaser for an online shop. Please append a second product teaser to the page with JavaScript based on the data given in the `index.js` file.

Use `.innerHTML` to generate the HTML elements for the teaser. Use string interpolation to include the given data into the HTML.

Add an event listener to the "buy" button of the second product teaser. When clicking the button, the product's name and price should be logged to the console.
