# Recap Project 5: Art Gallery

In this project, your team will create an interactive art gallery app.

This is a group project, so please create **only one project per group** following the [guide in the template section](./README.md#template).

## Overview

In this project, we will create an art gallery app with four pages: **Spotlight**, **Gallery**, **Favorite**, and **Detail**. Users can like or unlike art pieces, and liked pieces will appear on the **Favorite** page.

## API

We will fetch all necessary information about the art pieces from an API specifically designed for this course. [Check out the API](https://example-apis.vercel.app/api/art).

```bash
https://example-apis.vercel.app/api/art
```

## Template

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where your projects are stored.
2. Execute the following command to create a new project based on a template:

   ```bash
   npx ghcd@latest neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/templates/next art-gallery-app -i
   ```

3. Create a new empty repository on GitHub and add all group members as collaborators.
4. Link your local repository to the GitHub repository and push the code.
5. Each group member clones the repository to their local machine.
6. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file.

> ðŸ’¡ **Reminder**: Work on feature branches to avoid merge conflicts!

## Resources

Download a [Favorite Icon](https://lucide.dev/icons/) and save it in an "assets" folder within your app's main directory.

## Deploying Your Project

ðŸš€ Project Deployment to Vercel is required: Please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/neuefische/web-protocol-template/blob/main/docs/deployment-vercel.md) to deploy the project on Vercel.

### 7. Persist Favorites and Comments in the Browser

Currently, all data is saved using `useState`, meaning itâ€™s lost upon page refresh. To improve the user experience, we want to persist data in local storage. Keep in mind that when there is no data in local storage, weâ€™ll need to fetch everything from the API.

#### Value Proposition

**I want to** persist my favorites and comments

**so that** my data remains saved even if I close the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Value Proposition

**so that** I can find color inspiration.
