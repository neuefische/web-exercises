# Named vs Anonymous Callback

In this challenge, you will encounter the following tasks:

- passing a named callback function into a higher order function
- writing an anonymous arrow function inside the higher order function call

## Tasks

You should write a callback function in two different ways.
In both cases your callback function should log the following text to the console:
"Welcome! You are logged in now."

1. Write a function with the "function" keyword named "showWelcomeMessage"
   Call "handleUserLogin" and pass your callback function as the first argument.
   (You should see the log from your callback message)
2. Call "handleUserLogin" again but this time write an anonymous function **inside** the function call (i.e. between the round brackets). You can write an anonymous function either:

   - as an arrow function: ` () => {...}`
   - as a regular function: ` function() {...}`

3. Implement the logic from the previous from "showWelcomeMessage" inside this anonymous function.
4. Can you spot a difference in the behavior of the two ways you passed the callback functions to "handleUserLogin"?
