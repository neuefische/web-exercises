# JS DOM and Events: Dark Mode Example

This challenge offers a website with three buttons that currently have no functionality. Let’s add interactivity so the user can switch between light and dark modes, depending on their current mood.

## Tasks

Add interactivity to this website. Use the following hints as a guideline:

- If the `body` has the class "dark", the page displays in dark mode.
- Select all 3 buttons by their `data-js` attribute.
- Add an event listener to each button:
  - The “Switch to Dark Mode” button should add the class "dark" to the `body`.
  - The “Switch to Light Mode” button should remove the class "dark" from the `body`.
  - The “Toggle Mode” button should toggle the "dark" class on the `body`.

Switch to the `index.js` file to get started and bring some light to this dark page!

## Development
