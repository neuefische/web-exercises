# JS DOM and Events: Simple Calculator

In this challenge, you’ll use JavaScript to add interactivity to a simple calculator. You’ll work with `document.querySelector` and `addEventListener` to perform calculations when buttons are clicked.

## Tasks

1. Open the `index.html` file and take a look at the structure of the calculator. Notice that each button corresponds to a specific operation or action, but the calculator currently has no functionality.

2. Open the `./js/index.js` file and complete each step as described in the comments.

   - **Mathematical Operations**: Write code to perform each mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) when its corresponding button is clicked. Each operation should use `operand1` and `operand2`, then log the result to the console.
   - **Update the First Operand**: Implement functionality to update the value of `operand1` using the buttons in the "Update the First Operand" section. Each button should modify `operand1` and log the updated value.

Switch to the `./js/index.js` file to complete each task as described.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./js/index.js` file.

## Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
