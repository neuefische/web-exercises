# JS Modern Syntax: Back to Basics

In this challenge, you’ll revisit JavaScript before modern features like destructuring, default parameters, and the spread operator were widely used.

## Tasks

Your task is to rewrite a function that currently uses these modern features to achieve the same functionality without them. This exercise will deepen your understanding of what these features do by replicating their functionality manually.

Switch to the `./index.js` file to find the specific functions that need to be rewritten.

## Hints

- Carefully examine the current use of destructuring, default parameters, and spread syntax.
- Identify alternative methods to access properties, set defaults, and combine objects without these features.
- Use only the variable names provided in the task to ensure compatibility with the test cases.
- Make sure to export each function correctly to ensure tests run successfully.

## Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

Use `npm run test` to run the tests.

### Scripts

You can use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to start a development server
- `npm run test` to run the tests
- `npm run lint` to run the linter
