# Back to Basics: Rewrite without Modern JavaScript Syntax

In this challenge, you’ll revisit JavaScript before modern features like destructuring, default parameters, and the spread operator were common.

Your task is to take a function that uses these features and rewrite it so it will work without them. This is a great exercise to deepen your understanding of how these features work under the hood.

The exact task can be found in the respective exercises in the `./index.js` file

## Hints

- Carefully check how destructuring and spread syntax are used and find ways to achieve the same functionality without them.
- Use only the variable names specified in the task.
- Make sure to export each function correctly, so the tests work.

Please switch to the `./index.js` file to start the exercises.
