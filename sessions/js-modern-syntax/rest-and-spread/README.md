# Rest and Spread Syntax

In this Codesandbox, you will use a lot of dots `...` to train the rest and spread syntax.

The exact task can be found in the respective exercises in the [index.js](./index.js) file.

## Hints

- Use the variable names given in the task to destructure the given array.
- Make sure to export the variable you have declared in order to make the tests work.
- If you want to check whether you solved the tasks correctly, open the "Tests" tab of Codesandbox.

Please switch to the [index.js](./index.js) file to start the exercises.

## Development

### CodeSandbox

This project is JavaScript only so there is nothing to view in the "Browser" tab. Please select the "Tests" tab to check your progress.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies first using `npm i`.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run test` to run the tests once
- `npm run test:watch` to run the tests in watch mode
- `npm run lint` to run the linter

> ðŸ’¡ Since this project is JavaScript only there is nothing to preview in the browser. Use `npm run test:watch` to check your progress.
