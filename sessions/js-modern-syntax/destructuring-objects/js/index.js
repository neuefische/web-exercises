EXERCISE 1
Extract only the course name from the company object.
Make sure to export your variable as shown in the example below for the tests to work.
*/

/*
EXERCISE 2
We have an object called `user`.
Use destructuring to extract the following:
 2.1: The `name` property into a variable `name`.
 2.2: The `years` property into a variable `age`.
 2.3: The `isAdmin` property into the variable `isAdmin`.
      Set a default value of `false` if `isAdmin` is not present.

EXERCISE 3
Extract properties from the dog object and
rename them as `dogName`, `dogBreed`, and `dogAge`, respectively.

Extract the `lastName` property from the `person` object as `personLastName`.

EXERCISE 5
Refactor the following function to use destructuring assignment for the
three variables `name`, `country` and `numPeople`.
Hint: You may need to rename one property during destructuring.
