EXERCISE 1
a) Destructure the `person` object and extract the variables `age` and `contact`.
b) Use the rest parameter to collect the values of `name`, `email`, and `phone`
   and put them into `contact`.
c) Make sure to export your variable as shown in the example below to make the tests work.

Use array destructuring to extract the variables `first` and `second`;

EXERCISE 3
a) The `add` function does not work because it needs an array as an argument.

c) Make sure you understand what the rest syntax does here.
d) Note that the optional chaining `?.` is used to prevent an error from occuring.

EXERCISE 5
