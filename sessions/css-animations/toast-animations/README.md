# Toast Animation

In this Project you are going to practice animating properties in CSS!

## Task 1

The hover effect on the submit button can still be improved. Let's do that.

Find some rules you like and animate them with transitions.

- Use at least one timing-function
- Assign different durations
- Think of using delays

> Also check out the handout. It holds some answers to the questions that may come to you.

## Task 2

When you click the submit button, a toast appears in the upper left corner. Currently this toast is animated with transitions.

You have 2 options to solve this task.

You can now:

### Option 1 - Keep Transitions:

- Keep animating the toast with transitions
- Make the animation your own by changing it

  > Can be achieved without the use of JavaScript

### Option 2 - Change Transitions to keyframes: ( advanced )

- Change the way to animate the toast and use keyframes

  > Is much more versatile to customize, but holds far more pitfalls.

  > Probably needs adjustments of CSS and JavaScript.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`css/styles.css`](./css/styles.css) file to solve this tasks, but taking a look at the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) and making adjustments won't set you back in any case. Go for it!
