# Toast Animation

In this Project you are going to practice animating properties in CSS!

## Task 1

The hover effect on the toast button can still be improved. Let's do that.

Find some rules you like and animate them with transitions.

- Use at least one timing-function
- Assign different durations
- Think of using delays

> Also check out the handout. It holds some answers to the questions that may come to you.

## Task 2

When you click the submit button, a toast appears in the upper left corner. Currently this toast is animated with transitions.

Make it your own!  
Here are 3 options to start with:

### Option 1 - Keep Transitions:

Keep animating the toast with transitions.

### Option 2 - Change Transitions to keyframes:

Change the way to animate the toast and use keyframes.

> Is much more versatile to customize, but holds far more pitfalls.

### Option 3 - Add your own logic and css:

Do whatever you want.

> Can you animate the bodies background-color while holding your mouse down on the toast-button?

## Notes

- You only have to touch the [`css/styles.css`](./css/styles.css) file to solve this tasks, but taking a look at the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) and making adjustments won't set you back in any case. Go for it!
