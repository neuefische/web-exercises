# React State: Journal App Favorite Button

Now that you've setup your React Journal Project, it's time to include its most important feature: a button that allows you to favorite an entry.

## Task

If you have already written an `Entry` component, make sure to check whether you've added the markup for an image that potentially allows adding the functionality we want to implement. Strictly speaking, this doesn't need to be a button. It can be just an `<img />` element that behaves like a button. You'll need to have imported the provided `.svg` files into your project, as well.

You can use the following hints as a guideline:

- In your `Entry` component, you'll need to use a React Hook that allows you to declare and update a state variable.
- This state variable needs to be updated when the user is clicking the favorite button.
- You need to implement logic that handles switching out one `.svg` with the other.
- Happy Hacking!
