# React State: Journal App with Favorite Button State

Now that you've setup your Journal App Project, it's time to include our _favorite_ feature: a button that allows you to favorite an entry.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use this template as a starting point. But if you are far enough along with your own Journal App, please use that instead.

## Task

Locate the component with the favorite button. Here it's called `FavoriteButton`.

The component has an `isFavorite` boolean variable. This variable is used to determine if the star icon should be filled in or not.

- Make `isFavorite` a state variable.
- This state variable needs to be toggled when the user clicks the favorite button.
- Happy Hacking!
