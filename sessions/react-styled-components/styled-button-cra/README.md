# react-styled-components: Button Restyling

We currently have a `StyledButton` component that is styled using `styled-components`. Letâ€™s extend this by creating a `PrimaryButton` styled component that inherits styles from the `StyledButton` component and adds additional styles.

## Tasks

### Extend the `StyledButton` component to create a `PrimaryButton`

- You will need to create a new styled component `PrimaryButton` that extends the styles of the existing `StyledButton`.
- Make sure you import `styled` from `styled-components`. e.g.

```js
import styled from "styled-components";
```

- Apply new styles to the `PrimaryButton`, such as a different background color and font color.
- Use the `PrimaryButton` styled component in your `App.js`.
