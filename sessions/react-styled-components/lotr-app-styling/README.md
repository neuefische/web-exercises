-->

## Resources

⬇️ You can [download the design files and assets for the Journal App here](../../nextjs-basics-and-routing/lotr-app/design-resources.zip?raw=true).

- Unzip the file to get the resources folder.
- You can use the `[abc] Page [xyz].png` files as a reference for the design.
- If you like you can reference the original Figma design file: `lotr_app_design.fig`.
- The `variables.css` file contains the colors, fonts, and box shadows used in the design as CSS variables.
- Use the `arrow-left.svg`, `arrow-right.svg`, and `chevron-left.svg` files for the respective icon buttons. Import them in your components directly. See the documentation for adding svgs.
