# react-styled-components: styled navbar

In this challenge we want to style the `Link` component from [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link). This simple app has 3 pages that we can navigate between with the navbar in `_app.js`.

## Task

Switch to the `./pages/_app.js` file and make something great happen!

- Style the `Link` so that there is no underline. Hint: Check the handout for an example of how to do this. Additional hint: we can set [the following](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration) to `none`.
- Style the `Link` so that the `Link` gets underlined on hover.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./pages/index.js` file.
