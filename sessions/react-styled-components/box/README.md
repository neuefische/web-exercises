# Styled Components: Box

Currently, there is a component called [`BoxWithClassName`](./components/BoxWithClassName/index.js). This component is rendered twice in `./pages/_app.js`.

This is why there are two boxes displayed, a green and a black one. They become red when you hover over them. Their styling is done via BEM and the `className` attribute.

## Task

### Box with Styled Components

Create a new component called `BoxWithStyledComponents`. It should feature the same styling as `BoxWithClassName`.

You can use the following hints as guideline:

- Inside of the `components` folder, create a file `BoxWithStyledComponents.js`.
- It should export a styled component as default export 
  - Use a `div` element to style
  - Make use of string interpolation to check the `$isBlack` prop and adjust the background-color accordingly
  - Don't forget to add the styling for the hover effect
- Switch to `./pages/index.js`:
  - import `BoxWithStyledComponents` and
  - below the two `BoxWithClassName` components, render two `BoxWithStyledComponents`, one without and one with the `$isBlack` prop

### Bonus: Aligning Boxes Horizontally

Using styled components, can you align the four boxes horizontally by only changing `./pages/index.js`?

- Hint: Use `display: flex` to achieve this goal.


## Notes

- You have to touch the `./pages/index.js` file and add a file in the [`components`](./components/) folder.
