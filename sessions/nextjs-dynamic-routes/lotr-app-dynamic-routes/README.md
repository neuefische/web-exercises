# Next.js Dynamic Routes: Lord of the Rings App Dynamic Routes

Currently, the overview about the Lord of the Rings volumes is done with static routing. You are going to refactor the code with dynamic routes as well as links. Finally, you will create a button to navigate to a random volume.

## Task

### Refactor: Dynamic Routes

Refactor the static routes of the volume detail pages so that they use dynamic routes instead.

You can use the following hints as guideline:

- Create a `[slug].js` file in the `volumes` folder. This file will eventually replace the static volume detail pages.
- Inside of `[slug].js` recreate the `VolumeDetail` component which returns the same elements as the static version of the component. Adjust the code so that the content is now based around the `slug` from the `router.query` object.

### Refactor: Link to the Dynamic Routes

Refactor the volumes overview and create the links dynamically from the `volumes` array.

### Random Volume

On the volume overview page, create a button to navigate to a random volume.

This function will help you to get a random element from an array:

```js
function getRandomElement(array) {
  return array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
}
```

> ğŸ’¡ You will need to use `router.push()` in the event handler function.
