# React State 3: Tags

In the `./src/App.js` file, there is a `tags` state passed to the [`List`](./src/components/List/index.js) component. Each tag has a delete button.

There is also a [`Form`](./src/components/Form/index.js) component which already handles the submit event and the data.

Currently, it's not possible to add or remove a tag from state.

## Task

1. At first, make sure you understand the data flow; note that

- `Form` has a `onAddTag` prop and
- `List` a `onDeleteTag` prop which are not yet passed to them in the `App` component.

2. Write and wire up state updates to add and delete a tag.

You can use the following hints as guideline:

### Add a new Tag

- In the `App` component, write a `handleAddTag` function which receives one parameter, e.g. `newTag`.
- Call the state setter function and add the new tag to the current state.
- Pass `handleAddTag` to the `Form` component using the correct prop name.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, submitting the form now adds a new tag to the list!

### Remove a Tag

- In the `App` component, write a `handleDeleteTag` function which receives one parameter, e.g. `tagToDelete`.
- Call the state setter function and remove the tag from the current state.
- Pass `handleDeleteTag` to the `List` component using the correct prop name.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./src/App.js` file.
