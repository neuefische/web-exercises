Welcome to the treasure hunt!

Find the `treasure` on the treasure-island (the folder) only by browsing the folders inside your
terminal.

- `cd` to change directories
- `cd ..` to move up one folder
- `ls` to list files the current folder
- `cat <filename>` to see contents of a file
- `pwd` to see your current directory path
