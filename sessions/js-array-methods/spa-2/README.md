# Single Page Application (Part 2)

Up to now, we've used several HTML files for our app. In contrast, we can create a SPA
([single-page application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)): It loads only a
single web document and updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript.

In the following challenges, there is a dummy SPA of the Quiz App; additionally, there are two
enhanced versions which make use of `forEach` in order to improve and reduce the necessary code.

## Tasks

Working in groups, use the challenges `spa-1` to `spa-3`; make sure that every student understands every
single line of code and is able to explain it (don't worry, we are not going to ask you to do so).

## Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

> Alternatively you can use the Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code to view this project.  
> Select the HTML file you want to view, press <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>P</kbd>, search for `Live Preview: Show Preview` and confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Use `npm run test` to run the tests.
