# Single Page Application (Part 2)

Up to now, we've used several HTML files for our app. In contrast, we can create a SPA
([single-page application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)): It loads only a
single web document and updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript.

In the following codesandboxes, there is a dummy SPA of the Quiz App; additionally, there are two
enhanced versions which make use of `forEach` in order to improve and reduce the necessary code.

- [SPA_01: a working solution](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa/spa_01?file=/README.md)
- [SPA_02: simplified with `forEach`](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa/spa_02?file=/README.md)
- [SPA_03: `forEach` within `forEach`](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa/spa_03?file=/README.md)

**Task:**

Working in groups, use the codesandboxes above; make sure that every student understands every
single line of code and is able to explain it (don't worry, we are not going to ask you to do so).
