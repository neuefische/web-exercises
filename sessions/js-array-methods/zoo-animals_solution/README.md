# JS Array Methods 2: Zoo Animals

Our zoo has a lot of animals. These animals are shown on the website. To improve the user experience we want to implement a search field where the user can check whether a specific animal is included or not. The form is already implemented, but it's not working correctly yet. Take a look at the browser preview.

## Task

Look inside the `index.js`. There is a function called `hasAnimal`. Your task is to implement this function correctly.

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `./js/index.js` file.

## Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
