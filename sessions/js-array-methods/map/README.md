# Array Methods: `map`

This codesandbox offers a some exercises to recap the array method `map`. Let's dive directly into it!

## Task

In the [index.js](index.js) file, there is a `cards` array with three objects.

Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `lowerCaseAnswers`). They all are initialized with `null`.

And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code such that the variables have a value corresponding to their name. Use `map` to achieve this goal.

You will find some hints as comments.

Switch to the [index.js](index.js) file and map / filtersome recipes!
