# Repetition: `map` and `filter`

This codesandbox offers a some exercises to recap the array methods `map` and `filter`. Let's dive into them (again)!

## Task

In the [`index.js`](./index.js) file, there is a `recipes` array with four objects.

Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `onlyTitles`, `titlesWithDuration`, etc.). They are all initialized with `null`.

And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code so that the variables have a value corresponding their name. Use `map` and `filter` to achieve this goal.

You will find some hints as comments.

Switch to the [`index.js`](./index.js) file and map / filtersome recipes!

## Notes

- If you want to check whether you solved the tasks correctly, open the "Tests" tab of Codesandbox.

## Development

### CodeSandbox

This project is JavaScript only so there is nothing to view in the "Browser" tab. Please select the "Tests" tab to check your progress.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to run the main JavaScript file using `node`
- `npm run test` to run the tests once
- `npm run lint` to run the linter

> ðŸ’¡ Since this project is JavaScript only there is nothing to preview in the browser. Use `npm run test` to check your progress or `npm run start` to run the code.
