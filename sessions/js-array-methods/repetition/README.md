# Repetition: `map` and `filter`

This codesandbox offers a some exercises to recap the array methods `map` and `filter`. Let's dive into them (again)!

## Task

In the [index.js](index.js) file, there is a `recipes` array with four objects.

Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `onlyTitles`, `titlesWithDuration`, etc.). They are all initialized with `null`.

And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code so that the variables have a value corresponding their name. Use `map` and `filter` to achieve this goal.

You will find some hints as comments.

Switch to the [index.js](index.js) file and map / filtersome recipes!
