# Array Methods: `filter`

This codesandbox offers a some exercises to recap the array method `filter`. Let's dive directly into it!

## Task

In the [index.js](index.js) file, there is a `cards` array with three objects.

Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `onlyCardsWithTagHTML`). They are all initialized with `null`.

And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code such that the variables have a value corresponding to their name. Use `filter` to achieve this goal.

Switch to the [index.js](index.js) file and map / filtersome recipes!
