# JS Array Methods: `filter`

This challenge offers a some exercises to recap the array method `filter`. Let's dive directly into it!

## Tasks

In the `./index.js` file, there is a `cards` array with three objects.

Below this array, you will find a couple of variables (e.g. `onlyCardsWithTagHTML`). They are all initialized with `null`.

And now it's your turn: delete the value `null` and write code such that the variables have a value corresponding to their name. Use `filter` to achieve this goal.

Switch to the `./index.js` file and map / filtersome recipes!
