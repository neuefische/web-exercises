### Open and preview the new file in VS Code and the browser

- Step 1: Open the index.html file in VS Code.

Your website will now be opened in a browser preview. Any changes that you make to the index.html file will be automatically reflected in the browser preview.

This is a great way to see how your website will look before you deploy it to a live server.

Step 6: (Optional) If you want to have a browser preview that is embedded in VS Code, you can switch to the "Ports" tab in the VS Code status bar and click on the "Preview in Editor" button located in the "Local Address" column. This will open a browser preview right inside of VS Code.
