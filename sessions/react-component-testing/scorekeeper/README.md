# React Component Testing: Scorekeeper

This Scorekeeper app offers opportunities for game freaks: keep track of your game stats and watch a history as well!

To give you a short overview:

On the home page `localhost:3000/`, you can create a new game with entering a name of the game and the names of the participating players.

After starting a game, you are redirected to `/game`, where you can increase, decrease or reset all scores. When you are finished, you can end the tracking of scores.

Every finished game is also visible in the `/history` overview.

## Task

<!--

Explaining the task in detail. E.g.:
