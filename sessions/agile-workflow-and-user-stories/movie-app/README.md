# Challenge: User Stories for the Movie App

In this workshop we will practice to write good and concise users stories for a fictional movie app.

## User Story 1

Take a look at the [movie app wireframes](./assets/user-story-workshop-start.excalidraw). You can import this file at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) or use the [excalidraw vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) and get an overview about the features of the app.

Then, start writing the first user story in [this template](./user-story-1.md).

- You can orient yourself with the guide "How to write a user story?" inside the [excalidraw file](./assets/user-story-workshop-start.excalidraw).
- Make sure to use full sentences, clean english and give your user story enough detail.

After around 30min, meet again with the coach to discuss the first user story.

## User Story 2 & 3

Continue with the other user stories. Keep in mind to describe every **new** element and all possible interactions. Use the templates for [user story 2](./user-story-2.md) and [user story 3](./user-story-3.md).
