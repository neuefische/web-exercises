# Objects

Objects are everywhere. Let's become confident handling them!

## Task

In this exercise, you will encounter the following tasks:

- assign or add a variable to a value of an object,
- the variable itself is an object and you need to adjust it.

Please switch to the [index.js](index.js) file to start the exercises. You will find the exact tasks there.

## Notes

- If you want to check whether you solved the tasks correctly, open the "Tests" tab of Codesandbox.
- You only have to touch the `js/index.js` file.
