## Development

### CodeSandbox

This project is JavaScript only so there is nothing to view in the "Browser" tab. Please select the "Tests" tab to check your progress.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to run the main JavaScript file using `node`
- `npm run test` to run the tests once
- `npm run test:watch` to run the tests in watch mode
- `npm run lint` to run the linter

> ðŸ’¡ Since this project is JavaScript only there is nothing to preview in the browser. Use `npm run test:watch` to check your progress or `npm run start` to run the code.
