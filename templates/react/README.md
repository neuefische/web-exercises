# Fetching the Pokemon API

For now, the pokemon are only fetched when we click the button below. Let's change the code in such a way that our app does this automatically.

## Task

Switch to the [App.js](./src/App.js) file and

1. remove the 'Load Pokemon' button.
2. fetch pokemon when the app is rendered.

You can use the following hints as guideline:

- The `loadPokemon` function should only be executed when the app is rendered.
- Don't forget the dependency array!

## Notes

- You only have to touch the `App.js` file.
