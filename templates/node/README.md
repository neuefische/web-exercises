# This is a new Node project.

This project was created from the neue fische node template.

## Development

### CodeSandbox

This project is Node.js application. If it listens to any port (alÃ¡ `server.listen()`) CodeSandbox will open it in the "Browser" tab. Tests only seem to work locally.

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to run the main JavaScript file using `node`
- `npm run test` to run the tests
- `npm run lint` to run the linter

> ðŸ’¡ Since this project is Node.js application you have to run it using `npm run start` and then check your browser on the port the app is listening to. Use `npm run test` to check your progress.
